### Weblearning - putting the WE back into into the web

Welcome to my GitHub. This is where we publish and collaborate on the code for the Open Umbrella (primarily).

## Our community are the thirdspace
This is a community. There are educators and technologists from all over the world who contribute to the open umbrella :earth_africa:

If you are primariliy focussed in instructinal design, you might want to comment on the Open Umbrella website at ([https://www.bellingcat.com/](https://weblearning.co.za/umbrella/)).

### Want to contribute? :trophy:
You are most welcome to join the community work via GitHub. All are welcome, and there's never a stupid question.   I believe that by collaborating we can build better, educators informed tools that contribute to the class !
