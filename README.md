### Weblearning - putting the WE back into into the web

Welcome to Weblearning on GitHub. This is where we (well its me at the moment) publish and collaborate (primarily) on the Open Umbrella. You are most welcome to jump right in.

# How could you contribute?
There are many ways. They will reveal themselves as you begin your journey. But the best pace to start is by visiting the open umbrella itself 
Educators and technologists from all over the world are welcome to contribute to the open umbrella :earth_africa:
You can make this project better doing the following. You might ...
* discover the project [Open Umbrella](https://weblearning.co.za/umbrella/)
* engage and annotate (https://hypothes.is/) the resource
* participate in conversations about making badges (shields.io/badges). 
* share this work with department colleagues, personal learning networks [Substack](https://weblearning.substack.com)
* lead and assist with a community of Ed / Techies who are unfurling the open umbrella on GitHub (GitHub.com/web-learning)

If you are neither an edtechie or ID, You can report mistakes and errors, create more content, etc. 

## Want to contribute? :trophy:
You are most welcome to join the community work via GitHub. Whatever is your background, there is a
way to contribute: via the GitHub website, via command-line or even without
dealing with GitHub

All are welcome, and there's never a stupid question.   
I believe that by using [KIFF pedagogy](https://weblearning.co.za/blog/kiff/) we can build better, educators informed tools that contribute to the class !
